[openpv.de](https://openpv.de) started as a hobby project of some friends and myself. It now turned into a publicly funded open-source website.

### Basics

The website [openpv.de](https://openpv.de) offers users a comprehensive analysis of the solar energy potential of your buildings. By using openly available 3D building data, known as LOD2 data, OpenPV provides yield estimations for rooftop and balcony photovoltaic (PV) systems. The site's primary goal is to promote the installation of PV systems â€” an affordable and economically viable source of electricity in most locations today.
