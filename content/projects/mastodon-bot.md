The [@bundestagpetitionen10k](https://troet.cafe/@bundestagpetitionen10k) is a bot, that posts petitions from https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/ that have exceeded the threshold of 10,000 signatures. It visits the website of bundestag once per day to see if new petitions have reached this threshold. The bot is open-source and its code is on [github](https://github.com/FlorianK13/epetition-mastodon).
