The Python Package open-mastr provides an interface for accessing and cleaning the German Energy Unit dataset called Marktstammdatenregister (MaStR). The MaStR is a central registry with detailed information about renewable and conventional power plants in the German energy system. open-mastr enables the creation and updating of a local database of the entire registry, as well as processing the data for further evaluation. Ultimately, the package offers methods to reduce the registryâ€™s parsing time and thus enables energy system researchers to start working with the entire dataset right away.
